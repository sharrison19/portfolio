            One of the standout features of the forum application backend is its
            implementation of a recursive commenting system, allowing users to
            engage in multi-level discussions through comments and replies. This
            recursive structure enables users to respond to existing comments,

            essential thread details, such as title, author, date, comments, and
            views, users are encouraged to actively participate in discussions.
            Seamlessly navigating to detailed thread views further enriches the
            user experience, making the State page an invaluable asset to drive

            On the other hand, the Species page takes users on an immersive
            journey through the captivating world of fish species. The species
            cards feature a stunning flip animation, with an enticing image of
            the fish on the front and detailed descriptions on the back. Users
            can conveniently filter between saltwater and freshwater species,
            adding focus and convenience to their discovery. This interactive
            and visually appealing exploration makes the Species page a standout

          />
          <p>
            The Reel Northeast Profile page allows anglers to create and manage
            their profiles, enabling them to update their information, connect
            their social media accounts, and upload profile pictures using
            Cloudinary.
